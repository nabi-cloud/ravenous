## Future Work

### Search Autocomplete

A predictive search feature that suggests restaurant names, keywords, or locations as users type in the search bar. These suggestions should dynamically update based on the user's input, offering a quick and convenient way to refine search queries.

### Real-Time Search Results Refresh

Implement a real-time mechanism that updates search results as the user types in the search bar. 

### Sort by Distance or Radius

Introduce a sorting option that enables users to organize search results based on the distance from a central location. This feature should prioritize nearby restaurants, making it easier to discover options that align with their geographical preferences.
